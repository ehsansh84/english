### Write a story 
Once upon a day, I decided take a trip to the Italia. I went to my hotel, decided to stay for a week.   
I went to eat my breakfast, I ordered two pieces of toast. but waitress brought me only one piece.
I say: I want two piece! She says: go to the toilet!  
I say: You don't understand, I want two pieces on my plate
She say: You better not piss on the plate.


Once upon a time, I wanted to visit the local zoo. I bought a ticket and when there. It was so funny to watch animal. I took some monkey food with my self to feed them.
It was a nice experience after a few decades I have not visited the zoo. When I was visiting lions' cage, suddenly one of them comes directly to me, he roars mouth wide, and I can see his teeth. it's so scary specially when there is no fences between us.
After that I decided to visit small animal cages to have more fun.
