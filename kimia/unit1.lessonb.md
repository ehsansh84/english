### Section 2: How I ended up living in New York City
A lot of people ask me how I ended up `living` in New York City.
Well, actually, I wasn't planning on `being`
here. It's just that the opportunity came up when my friend Samuela
happened `to move` here for college. She needed a roommate,
so I agreed `to share` an apartment with her in the city. We were
only in the apartment a couple of months when Samuela started
`missing` \ `to miss` home. She said she missed `being` with her family.
I guess she couldn't imagine `staying` \ `to stay` three more years and
`being` happy. So, she decided `to complete` the semester,
and then she transferred to a college back home. Anyway,
I kept the apartment and found a great job. I've been here for over
six years now, but Samuela and I are still great friends. We've never
stopped `emailing` each other, and we call each other all the
time. We just live in different cities - that's all!
